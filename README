How much should I rent my flat per night?

We use various Machine Learning models for predicting the night price of an appartment on Airbnb.

# Conclusion

After selecting relevent data and preprocessing it, we used it to train four models:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Deep Neural Network Regression

We compared these models between one another and with a simple rule of thumb (predicting the price of an Airbnb flat by using the mean price in Paris).
We obtained the following results:

| Rule of thumb | Linear Regression | Polynomial Regression | Random Forest Regression | Deep Neural Network Regression |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
|      77       |        60         |          54           |           51             |              49                |

The Deep Neural Network Regression currently offers the best results, but the Random Forest Regression, with a training error of only 20, might be the machine learning model with the best room for improvement.
